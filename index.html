    <h2>CV Description</h2>
    <p>I believe in the balance of mechanics and story-telling, I strive to create games 
	that are not only fun to play but also provide a meaningful and memorable experience for the player.
	I have experience in designing game mechanics such as combat systems, progression systems,
	and puzzles and also have experience in writing and creating characters, plot, and dialogue.
	I am particularly interested in creating narrative-driven games that focus on world-building and player choice. 
	My goal is to continue to push 
	the boundaries of what is possible in the game design industry and to create truly unforgettable games that leave a lasting impact on the players.</p>
